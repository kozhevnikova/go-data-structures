# Implementing Data Structures in Go

This repository contains examples of classical data structures.

## Stack
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves 
a collection of elements that are inserted and removed according to 
the LIFO (last-in, first-out) principle. Which means the last element 
you put in the stack is the first you take out.
